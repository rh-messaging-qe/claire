# Broker-QE Java System Tests

This repository contains code for testing AMQ Broker/Artemis operator and it's operands.

It uses fabric8 for communication with Kubernetes API.
For details of usage fabric8 client see perfect [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/v6.8.1/doc/CHEATSHEET.md), which contains all resources with examples.

[CRDs](crds) contains Either upstream or downstream CRDs for AMQ Broker 7.10.x. Currently, we only support downstream, as upstream versions are different (imports are different) and
we need to solve this problem nicely. If you're using upstream, please update all imports manually (find all and replace) accordingly.

## How to run tests

Test suite expects you to be logged into some kind of Kubernetes instance (minikube, k3s, Kubernetes, ..).
Currently, we support running `test_smoke_downstream` and `test_smoke_upstream` (which executes `SmokeTests` and `ClusteredOperatorSmokeTests`) tests using `make`.
These targets will execute all necessary steps - clean, download files, build and generate needed code and finally execute tests.
Review `Makefile` for more details.

To execute specific tests with maven, you need to build project (make) and execute maven tests, with skipping clean & compilation part
```bash
make build_upstream
mvn test -Dmaven.main.skip=true -Dtest=<my-specific-test>
```

By default, Claire executes tests with `file based` Artemis Cloud Cluster Operator deployment, which is downloaded from provided installation examples.

## How to run tests with OLM
To override default file based Artemis Cloud Cluster Operator installation by Operator Lifecycle Management,
you need to specify `OLM` to `true` to install latest available OLM (installed from Redhat Operators). If you wanted to use older LTS operator, specify `OLM_LTS` to `true`.

If you would want to try your own OLM operator, you would need to specify only following two parameters:
`OLM_IIB` Index Image Bundle and `OLM_CHANNEL` environment variables, which specifies Subscription channel to use for Operator installation.

## Setting log level
Currently, there is supported `TEST_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, which can set desired logging level of test suite.
By default, we use `INFO` level. Supported values are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `OFF`.

## Disable generating random suffices for namespaces
Set environment variable `DISABLE_RANDOM_NAMESPACES` to `false` to disable using random suffix in namespace names. This is useful for debugging purposes.
Example `test-namespace-2a6c` will be always `test-namespace`.

## Structure of PACKAGE_MANIFEST file
A list of expected AMQ Broker Operator versions, for example:
```shell
7.10.0.OPR.4.CR1
7.10.1.OPR.2.CR1
7.10.6.OPR.1.CR1
7.10.7.OPR.1.CR2
7.11.0.OPR.3.CR1
7.11.1.OPR.2.CR1
7.11.2.OPR.1.CR3
7.11.3.OPR.1.CR1
```

## Hints
- keep code clean

## Attribution
The very core of this test suite is based on [Strimzi systemtest module](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator).
